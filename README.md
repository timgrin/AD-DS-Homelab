# AD DS-Homelab
Simulated an Enterprise Network Deployment in HomeLab: Setup a Domain Controller, Active Directory, and 1000+ Users using PowerShell Script.
This entails the following:


**Active Directory Domain Services/ Domain: This allows admins to manage and store information about resources from the network.

•	 RAS/NAT: This allows the client to access internet resources.

•	 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol: This automatically provides and assigns IP addresses to the client device.

•	 Powershell Script: This was used to create users on the active directory.

•	 Windows 10 Client: This was connected to the network to test the domain controller.
